# Nurrnix Emulator

This is an emulator for the Nurrnix Userland Runtime Regurgiator (NURR). 

## Standards

All source code should compile on NurrNix's *Serious Plus Plus Compiler* version 0.0.0, which is the current version of NurrNix.

## Hardware

The kernel boots only on Samsung hardware, and never on iPhones, because Macs get viruses too.

# TODO

Everything.
